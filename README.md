  ### 1-)WHERE YOU KEPP THE MESSAGE?
   Before ı start ı wanna say ı am using ajax load method.For that ı need to load every second doesnt matter mesaage is arrive or not
    so that ı am keep the message in the txt files.Every friends message box txt files is different and when they send mesaage it will
    be added in their txt file.With this way ı can load txt files content in every second.İf ı would use the databse for messages it
    will be disaster for the server and it will be so slow.
